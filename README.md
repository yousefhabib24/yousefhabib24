# 🌟 About Me:

I am a first-year cybersecurity student at the Rochester Institute of Technology Dubai. I'm passionate about how networks, systems, and people connect and how they can be protected. I’m building a strong foundation in Python, networking, and systems security, and I’m excited to grow through hands-on labs, real-world challenges, and continuous learning.

## 🚀 What I’m Up To:

* 🛠️ Building small security-focused projects to strengthen my fundamentals
* 🤖 Studying networking, system security, and Python through hands-on labs
* 📚 Learning academic foundations to prepare for future certifications
